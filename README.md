## What is Hermes Studio?

Hermes Studio is an open-source, self-hosted web dashboard for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) by [NousResearch](https://nousresearch.com). It turns the Hermes AI agent into a full workspace you can control from your browser — with multi-agent orchestration, cron job scheduling, execution approvals, MCP server management, and 30+ features no other Hermes UI offers. Works with Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible backend. Built with React, TypeScript, and TanStack. MIT licensed.

## ⏰ Cron Job Manager — a feature no other UI has

Every other Hermes/Claude web interface treats the agent as a request-response tool. You send a message, you get a reply.

Hermes Studio is the only one that lets you **schedule the agent as a background worker** — running prompts on a timer, automatically, while you do something else.

No `crontab -e`. No shell scripts. No babysitting.

From the Jobs tab you can:

- **Create jobs** with a natural-language prompt and a schedule — presets (every 15 min, hourly, daily, weekly) or any custom cron expression
- **Pick delivery channels** — route job output to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or Signal so you get notified when the run completes
- **Set skills and repeat counts** — attach specific skills to a job; cap how many times it reruns automatically
- **Pause / Resume** without deleting — freeze a job during a holiday, unfreeze it Monday morning
- **Trigger now with live streaming** — run any job immediately and watch real-time tool events, token output, and completion status stream directly into the job card — no polling, no page reload
- **Edit live** — change the prompt, schedule, or channels without recreating the job
- **Monitor inline** — expand any job card to see the last N run outputs with timestamps, or watch a live SSE event log while a manual run is in progress
- **Auto-refresh** — the job list polls every 30 seconds; you never need to reload

### What this unlocks

| Use case | How |
|---|---|
| Daily briefing | Schedule a "summarise my emails and calendar" prompt every morning at 7am, delivered to Telegram |
| Repo health check | Run a code analysis prompt every night; get a Slack message only if issues found |
| Price / data monitor | Poll an API every 15 minutes; alert on thresholds |
| Automated reports | Weekly Markdown report generated into your workspace files |
| Maintenance tasks | Prune old memory entries, rotate logs, sync data — on a schedule, unattended |

The gateway already runs the jobs. Hermes Studio is the control plane that makes them manageable without a terminal.

## What's different from hermes-workspace

Hermes Studio is a fork of [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) extended with:

- ✅ **Cron Job Manager** — the headline feature above; no other UI has it
- ✅ **Execution Approvals UI** — approve, deny, or always-allow dangerous agent actions from the browser with expand/context and three approval scopes
- ✅ **Skill Installation** — install, uninstall, and toggle skills from the skillsmp.com registry directly in the browser
- ✅ **Permissions & Toolsets** — configure approvals mode, command allowlist, toolsets, website blocklist, code execution limits, and reasoning effort from Settings
- ✅ **Chat Platform Tokens** — set Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Signal bot tokens from the Integrations settings page (no `.env` editing required)
- ✅ **Session Persistence** — chat history survives server restarts; Redis backend auto-connects to `localhost:6379` and falls back to file store gracefully
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Crews: named groups of persona agents, parallel task dispatch, live SSE activity feed, per-member status tracking
- ✅ **Profile-Scoped Workspaces** — each agent works inside an isolated directory (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/`) so crews don't collide on the file system
- ✅ **Interactive Knowledge Graph** — force-directed canvas in the Memory screen: zoom, pan, drag nodes, hover to highlight connections, nodes sized by degree
- ✅ **Visual Workflow Builder** — DAG editor for orchestrating sequential and parallel agent task pipelines; nodes, bezier edges, auto-layout, and live execution with SSE status updates per node
- ✅ **Crew Templates** — 7 built-in templates across 4 categories (Research Team, Deep Dive, Full-Stack Squad, Code Review Crew, Content Studio, Ops Team, Sprint Team); save your own templates; one-click pre-fill of the create-crew dialog
- ✅ **Cost Tracking** — Usage tab on every crew detail screen; per-agent input/output token counts pulled from Hermes session API after each run; estimated cost using a built-in model price table; crew-level and per-member totals; reset control; requires Hermes enhanced mode
- ✅ **MCP Server Management** — Settings → MCP Servers: add/edit/delete stdio and HTTP MCP servers; "Save to Config" writes directly to `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and auto-triggers a live reload; YAML copy fallback retained for environments where file access is unavailable
- ✅ **Agent Library** — new `/agents` screen: create custom agents with system prompt, emoji, color, role label, model override, and tags; built-in personas ship with default system prompts; custom agents surface in crew builder and template gallery dropdowns; full CRUD via `/api/agents` REST API; persisted in `.runtime/agent-definitions.json`
- ✅ **Audit Trail** — new `/audit` screen: cross-session chronological timeline of all tool calls (with phase/args/result), user messages, and approval requests; backed by `GET /api/audit/`; filters by session, event type (Tool Call, User Message, Approval), and date range; tool event cards expand inline to show full args and result; 50-event pagination
- ✅ **Clone Crew** — `POST /api/crews/:crewId/clone`; duplicates name/goal/member roster, mints fresh sessions for all members in parallel; clone button on the crew grid card (hover) and on the detail screen header; navigates directly to the new crew on success; inspired by xaspx/hermes-control-interface + karmsheel/mission-control-hermes
- ✅ **Hermes v0.9.0 compatibility** — Fast Mode toggle (`/fast`), `/compress` and `/debug` slash commands, API_SERVER_KEY field, one-click backup/import, BlueBubbles + WeChat + WeCom platform integrations, rate-limit header display in provider usage meter
- ✅ **Hermes v0.8.0 compatibility** — Logs viewer screen (`~/.hermes/logs/`), cron delivery failure badges, pre-run script field in job creation
- ✅ **Conductor V2** — Gateway-native orchestration with animated SVG office, pixel-art avatars, live worker monitoring, settings, mission history, cost tracking, quick actions, abort/pause/retry
- ✅ **Operations Dashboard** — Unified agent overview across crews and conductor missions; grid/outputs toggle; status filters; also available as a per-crew Operations tab
- ✅ **Tasks / Kanban Board** — Five-column drag-and-drop board with priority, tags, source cross-links; conductor missions auto-create linked tasks

---

### 💰 Cost Tracking

Every crew gets a **Usage** tab on its detail screen. After each agent run completes, Hermes Studio fetches the accumulated token counts from the Hermes session API and records them per agent.

The tab shows:
- **KPI strip** — total tokens, input/output split, estimated total cost
- **Per-agent breakdown** — input tokens, output tokens, estimated cost per member; shows model badge and dashes for portable mode sessions
- **Reset control** — clear all usage data for a crew at any time

Cost estimates use a built-in price table covering Anthropic (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), OpenAI (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, o1/o3), and Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) with fuzzy model matching and an `__unknown__` fallback. Prices are for reference only.

Token data requires Hermes enhanced mode (a connected Hermes backend). Portable mode sessions show dashes with a notice.

---

### 📋 Crew Templates

Launching a new crew from scratch every time gets repetitive. Templates let you jump-start with a proven composition:

**Built-in templates (7 total, 4 categories):**

| Category | Template | Composition |
|---|---|---|
| Research | Research Team | Luna (analyst), Ada (reviewer), Kai (coordinator) |
| Research | Deep Dive | Luna + Roger (analysts), Kai (coordinator) |
| Engineering | Full-Stack Squad | Kai (coordinator), Roger (frontend), Sally (backend), Max (DevOps), Ada (QA) |
| Engineering | Code Review Crew | Ada (executor), Luna (reviewer), Nova (security) |
| Creative | Content Studio | Bill (coordinator), Luna (writer), Roger (reviewer) |
| Operations | Ops Team | Max (coordinator), Sally + Kai (executors) |
| Operations | Sprint Team | Kai (coordinator), Roger + Sally (executors), Ada (reviewer) |

Clicking **Templates** in the Crews header opens a filterable gallery. Selecting a template closes the gallery and pre-fills the New Crew dialog with the template's name, goal, and member roster — edit anything before confirming.

User-created templates are saved to `.runtime/templates.json` and persist across restarts. Delete them at any time from the gallery (built-ins are protected).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Hermes Studio works with any OpenAI-compatible backend. If your backend also exposes Hermes gateway APIs, enhanced features like sessions, memory, skills, approvals, and jobs unlock automatically.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **An OpenAI-compatible backend** — local, self-hosted, or remote
- **Optional:** Python 3.11+ if you want to run a Hermes gateway locally

### Step 1: Start your backend

Point Hermes Studio at any backend that supports:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `GET /v1/models` recommended

Example Hermes gateway setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
hermes setup
hermes --gateway
```

If you're using another OpenAI-compatible server, just note its base URL.

### Step 2: Install & Run Hermes Studio

```bash
# In a new terminal
git clone https://github.com/JPeetz/Hermes-Studio.git
cd Hermes-Studio
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
printf '\nHERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642\n' >> .env
pnpm dev                   # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

> **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the onboarding flow. First connect the backend, then verify chat works. If your gateway exposes Hermes APIs, advanced features appear automatically.

### Environment Variables

```env
# OpenAI-compatible backend URL
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642

# Optional provider keys for Hermes gateway-managed config
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Optional: password-protect the web UI
# HERMES_PASSWORD=your_password

# Optional: override Redis URL (defaults to redis://localhost:6379)
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

> **Redis is optional.** Hermes Studio automatically tries to connect to a local Redis instance for session persistence. If Redis isn't running, it silently falls back to file-based storage — no configuration needed.

---

## 🧠 Local Models (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)

Hermes Studio supports two modes with local models:

### Portable Mode (Easiest)

Point Hermes Studio directly at your local server — no Hermes gateway needed:

```bash
# Start Ollama
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve

# Start Hermes Studio pointed at Ollama
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 pnpm dev
```

Chat works immediately. Sessions, memory, skills, and jobs show "Not Available" — that's expected in portable mode.

### Enhanced Mode (Full Features)

Route through the Hermes gateway for sessions, memory, skills, jobs, and tools:

**1. Configure your local model in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:**

```yaml
provider: ollama
model: qwen2.5:7b # or any model you have pulled
custom_providers:
  - name: ollama
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
    api_key: ollama
    api_mode: chat_completions
```

**2. Enable the API server in `~/.hermes/.env`:**

```env
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
```

**3. Start the gateway and workspace:**

```bash
hermes gateway run          # Starts on :8642
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642 pnpm dev
```

All workspace features unlock automatically — sessions persist, memory saves across chats, skills are available, and the dashboard shows real usage data.

> **Works with any OpenAI-compatible server** — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, etc. Just change the `base_url` and `model` in the config above.

---

## 🐳 Docker Quickstart

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Codespaces-Open-181717?logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=JPeetz/Hermes-Studio)

The Docker setup runs both the **Hermes Agent gateway** and **Hermes Studio** together.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Anthropic API Key** — [Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) (required for the agent gateway)

### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JPeetz/Hermes-Studio.git
cd Hermes-Studio
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

> **Important:** The `hermes-agent` container requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to function. Without it, the gateway will fail to authenticate.

### Step 2: Start the Services

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts two services:

- **hermes-agent** — The AI agent gateway (port 8642)
- **hermes-studio** — The web UI (port 3000)

### Step 3: Access the Workspace

Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the onboarding.

> **Verify:** Check the Docker logs for `[gateway] Connected to Hermes` — this confirms the workspace successfully connected to the agent.

- Assign skills and set repeat limits per job
- Edit any field on a live job without recreating it
- Pause and resume without losing configuration
- Trigger immediately on demand
- Expand any job card to read recent run output inline
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

### 👥 Multi-Agent Crews

Coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel toward a shared goal — all from a single UI.

- **Create crews** — give each crew a name, a goal, and up to 8 agent members
- **Persona agents** — pick from specialised personas (Roger / Frontend, Sally / Backend, Ada / QA, Kai / General, and more) each with a role label, emoji, and colour
- **Per-member model** — assign any model to any agent independently
- **Dispatch tasks** — send a prompt to all agents simultaneously or target a specific member
- **Live activity feed** — SSE events from all crew members stream into a unified timeline in real time; tool calls, messages, and errors are colour-coded
- **Status indicators** — idle / running / done / error shown with animated pulse on each member card
- **"Open chat"** link on every member card navigates directly to that agent's chat session
- **Persistence** — crews and their member status survive server restarts (file-backed crew store)

### 🔀 Visual Workflow Builder

The Crew detail screen's **Workflow tab** is a full DAG editor for building and running structured task pipelines.

- **SVG canvas** — pure-SVG rendering; no external graph library required; pan, zoom (0.2×–4×), and node drag with pointer capture
- **Add tasks** — each task has a label, a full prompt sent to the agent, and an assignee (any crew member or "all agents")
- **Draw dependencies** — activate Connect mode, click a source node then a target to draw a bezier edge with arrowhead; a dependency means the target task only runs after the source completes
- **Cycle detection** — creating a cycle shows an immediate error and discards the edge; server-side validation also rejects cycles on save
- **Auto Layout** — Kahn's BFS topological sort lays nodes out in parallel columns, left-to-right, with vertical centering per layer
- **Persistent** — workflow is saved per crew in `.runtime/workflows.json` (file-backed, same pattern as the crew store)
- **Run Workflow** — click Run to execute tasks in topological order: root tasks dispatch in parallel; each layer waits for all its tasks to complete (via SSE `run_end` events) before the next layer dispatches
- **Live node status** — each node shows a colour-coded tinted border and badge: idle → running (green pulse) → done (indigo) → error (red); active edges also highlight in green
- **Edge deletion** — click any edge (wide invisible hit area) to remove the dependency
- **Task edit panel** — click a node to open a right-side panel showing full prompt, assignee, dependencies, live status; double-click to edit inline

### 🗂️ Profile-Scoped Workspaces

Every crew member can be assigned a named profile that scopes their file system access to an isolated directory.

- Each profile resolves to `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/` — auto-created on first use
- The File Explorer sidebar shows the profile's workspace root, not the global workspace
- All file operations (read, write, upload, delete, rename, mkdir) are profile-aware
- Path traversal is prevented server-side — profile names are validated, `../` is rejected
- The active profile drives the file explorer in the main chat screen via `useActiveProfile` hook

### 🕸️ Interactive Knowledge Graph

The Memory screen's graph view is now a fully interactive force-directed canvas — not a static circle.

- **Force-directed layout** — nodes spread naturally; hubs cluster, orphans spread to the edges; computed synchronously on load (280 iterations of Coulomb repulsion + Hooke spring attraction)
- **Node sizing by degree** — highly-connected hubs appear larger; isolated nodes stay small
- **Node type colours** — guide, project, reference, concept, note each get a distinct palette; legend shown only when typed nodes exist in the data
- **Hover highlights** — hover any node to illuminate its direct connections and dim everything else to 22% opacity; a glow ring marks the hovered node
- **Zoom** — mouse wheel (non-passive, doesn't scroll the page) + +/− buttons; 0.25×–4× range
- **Pan** — drag the background to move the viewport
- **Node drag** — drag individual nodes to reposition them; position is pinned for the session
- **Stats counter** — `N nodes · M edges` shown in the bottom-right corner

### 🔐 Permissions & Toolsets

- Approvals mode selector (auto / always / never)
- Approval timeout control
- Command allowlist editor — tag-input for shell commands that bypass Tirith
- Toolset add/remove
- Website blocklist toggle + domain editor
- Code execution limits
- Reasoning effort selector
- All settings persist live via the config API

### 🔗 Integrations

- skillsmp.com API key for skill marketplace access
- Chat platform tokens — set Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal bot tokens directly from the UI without editing `.env`

### 📁 Files

- Full workspace file browser
- Navigate directories, preview and edit files
- Monaco editor integration

### 💻 Terminal

- Full PTY terminal with cross-platform support
- Persistent shell sessions
- Direct workspace access

### 🎨 Themes

- 8 themes: Official, Classic, Slate, Mono — each with light and dark variants
- Theme persists across sessions
- Full mobile dark mode support

### 💾 Session Persistence

- Chat sessions and message history survive server restarts
- Auth tokens persist across restarts — no forced re-login
- Active run dedup state persists — no duplicate runs on restart
- Redis backend auto-connects to `localhost:6379` on startup; gracefully falls back to file store if Redis is not available
- Override with `REDIS_URL` for remote or non-default Redis

### 🔒 Security

- Auth middleware on all API routes
- CSP headers via meta tags
- Path traversal prevention on file, memory, and skill uninstall routes
- Rate limiting on endpoints
- Optional password protection for web UI
- Execution approvals — dangerous commands require explicit user sign-off

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Workspace loads but chat doesn't work"

The workspace auto-detects your gateway's capabilities on startup. Check your terminal for a line like:

```
[gateway] http://127.0.0.1:8642 available: health, models; missing: sessions, skills, memory, config, jobs
[gateway] Missing Hermes APIs detected. Update Hermes: cd hermes-agent && git pull && pip install -e . && hermes --gateway
```

**Fix:** Make sure you have the latest Hermes Agent with extended gateway support:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent && pip install -e . && hermes --gateway
```

### "Connection refused" or workspace hangs on load

Your Hermes gateway isn't running. Start it:

```bash
cd hermes-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
hermes gateway run
```

### Ollama: chat returns empty or model shows "Offline"

Make sure your `~/.hermes/config.yaml` has the `custom_providers` section and `API_SERVER_ENABLED=true` in `~/.hermes/.env`. See [Local Models](#-local-models-ollama-lm-studio-vllm) above.

Also ensure Ollama is running with CORS enabled:

```bash
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` (not `localhost`) as the base URL.

Verify: `curl http://localhost:8642/health` should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

### "Using upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent"

The upstream hermes-agent supports basic chat via `hermes --gateway`, but older versions may not include extended endpoints (sessions, memory, skills, config). Hermes Studio will work in **portable mode** with basic chat. For full features, ensure you have the latest version: `cd hermes-agent && git pull && pip install -e .`

### Docker: "Unauthorized" or "Connection refused" to hermes-agent

If using Docker Compose and getting auth errors:

1. **Check your API key is set:**

   ```bash
   cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   # Should show: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

2. **View the agent container logs:**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs hermes-agent
   ```

   Look for startup errors or missing API key warnings.

3. **Verify the agent health endpoint:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8642/health
   # Should return: {"status": "ok"}
   ```

4. **Restart with fresh containers:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. **Check workspace logs for gateway status:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs hermes-studio
   ```
   Look for: `[gateway] http://hermes-agent:8642 mode=...` — if it shows `mode=disconnected`, the agent isn't running correctly.

### Docker: "hermes webapi command not found"

The `hermes webapi` command referenced in older docs doesn't exist. The correct command is:

```bash
hermes --gateway   # Starts the FastAPI gateway server
```

The Docker setup uses `hermes --gateway` automatically — no action needed if using `docker compose up`.

## 🗑️ Uninstall

Run the included script from inside the project folder:

```bash
bash scripts/uninstall.sh
```

This will:
1. Stop and disable the systemd service (if installed)
2. Kill any running `server-entry.js` process
3. Ask for confirmation, then delete the project folder (including `.runtime/` data)

**Data locations removed with the project folder:**

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `.runtime/events.db` | Analytics SQLite database |
| `.runtime/costs.json` | Token cost history |
| `.runtime/crews.json` | Saved agent crews |
| `.runtime/workflows.json` | Crew workflows |
| `.runtime/agent-definitions.json` | Custom agent definitions |
| `.runtime/local-sessions.json` | Session metadata |
| `.runtime/templates.json` | Message templates |

**Manual steps after the script:**

- **Browser localStorage** — open DevTools → Application → Storage → Local Storage → clear the entry for `http://localhost:<port>`
- **`~/.hermes/`** — this belongs to Hermes Agent, not Hermes Studio. Do not delete it unless you are also uninstalling Hermes Agent.
- **Redis** — if you used password protection, session tokens in Redis will expire naturally (or run `redis-cli FLUSHDB` to clear immediately).
